# Uncomment the line below to output into a fits file (smaller file, faster
# output, but not human readable).
#
# Tip: you can change the output file with --output command line option
# Tip #2: if outputing to text, adding a .gz to the end of the filename
# specified with --output will make the file gzipped.  Adding bz2 will make
# it bzipped. These have no effect on FITS output
